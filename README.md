# CLS-Argos-Linkit-CORE

Welcome to the CLS-Argos-Linkit-CORE repository! This repository serves as the firmware repository for the Linkit Core device. It is compatible with the GenTracker phone app and works seamlessly with the Pylinkit python tool. Here, you'll find all the necessary firmware files for the Linkit Core device, enabling you to customize and optimize your tracking solutions.

Linkit represents the evolution and consolidation of the Horizon board and the satellite daughter board, which is based on the Artic R2 chipset. It functions as a tracker or beacon utilizing Argos satellite communication. This firmware is also compatible for the Horizon board.

# How to Contribute

Thank you so much for offering to help out. We truly appreciate it.

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the issues and pull requests to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you decide to add a feature to this library, please create a PR following these best practices:

* Change as little as possible. Do not sumbit a PR that changes 100 lines of whitespace. Break up into multiple PRs if necessary.
* If you've added a new feature document it with a simple example sketch. This serves both as a test of your PR and as a quick way for users to quickly learn how to use your new feature.
* If you add new functions also add them to keywords.txt so that they are properly highlighted in Arduino. Read more.
* Please submit your PR using the release_candidate branch. That way, we can merge and test your PR quickly without changing the master branch
