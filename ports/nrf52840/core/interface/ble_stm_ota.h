 * @brief STM OTA Update Service
 *
 * @details This module implements the STM OTA Update Service (0000FE20-8E22-4541-9D4C-21EDAE82ED19) comprising the following characteristics:
 *
 *          Base Address (0000FE22-8E22-4541-9D4C-21EDAE82ED19) - 4 bytes
 *            Byte 0 - Actions:  0=>STOP all upload, 1=>START file upload, 2=>start user app upload, 7=>upload finished
 *                            :  8=>cancel upload
 *            Bytes 1-3: Address: 0xXXXXXX
 *
 *          File Upload End Status (0000FE23-8E22-4541-9D4C-21EDAE82ED19)
 *            Byte 0 - File Reception: 0=>OK, 1=>Interrupted, FF=>Ignore
 *            Byte 1 - File Integrity: 0=>OK, 1=>Not OK, FF=>Ignore
 *            Byte 2 - Start Upload: 0=>OK, 1=>Invalid Base Addr 2=>Busy, FF=>Ignore
 *
 *          OTA Raw Data (0000FE24-8E22-4541-9D4C-21EDAE82ED19)
 *            Bytes 0-19: Raw File Data
 *
 *          During initialization, the module adds the characteristics to the BLE stack database.
 *
 *          The application must supply an event handler for receiving events. Using this handler, the service notifies
 *          the application when OTA Update Service events arise.
 *
 *          The service also provides a function for letting the application notify the success/failure of
 *          an OTA update operation via the "File Upload End Status" characteristic.
 *
 * @note    The application must register this module as a BLE event observer using the
 *          NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER macro. Example:
 *          @code
 *              ble_hids_t instance;
 *              NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER(anything, BLE_STM_OTA_BLE_OBSERVER_PRIO,
 *                                   ble_stm_ota_on_ble_evt, &instance);
 *          @endcode
